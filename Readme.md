# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor

Implementation in pytorch based on: 
[**Low-Level control of a quadrotor with deep model-based reinforcement learning**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8769882)

[**Learning to adapt in dynamic, real-world environments through meta-reinforcement learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11347)

For simulated quadrotor in VREP simulator
