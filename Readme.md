# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor

Implementation of Quadrotor Model-based Learning in pytorch and VREP Simulator based of the following papers: 

[**Low-Level control of a quadrotor with deep model-based reinforcement learning**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8769882)

[**Learning to adapt in dynamic, real-world environments through meta-reinforcement learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11347)

# Current Progress
We are testing separately Fault-Free Case, and in Fault-Motor 1 case.

**Fault-Free Case**

**Fault-M1 Case**

**Same Comparison in 3D plots, Left Fault free, Right Fault Motor 1**
