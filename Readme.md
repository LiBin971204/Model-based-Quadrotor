# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotor

Implementation in pytorch based on **Low-Level control of a quadrotor with deep model-based reinforcement learning**
and **Learning to adapt in dynamic, real-world environments through meta-reinforcement learning**

for simulated quadrotor in VREP simulator
